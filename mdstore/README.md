# mdstore

`mdstore` is a Rust daemon for a Git-tracked Markdown knowledge repository. It
validates repository-defined schemas, exposes hashline-safe atomic edits, keeps
adjacent binary embedding sidecars, and serves exact, vector, graph-assisted,
and reranked search over MCP.

Markdown, root `config.yaml`, and directory `template.md` files are canonical.
Adjacent `*.mdstore` embedding files are disposable and ignored by Git. No
repository `.mdstore/` directory is needed; daemon state lives in Git's private
directory.

```gitignore
*.mdstore
```

## Repository configuration

Every served repository tracks a root `config.yaml` with operational settings
only. Document rules belong exclusively in directory templates. Both kinds of
configuration are readable but cannot be changed through `apply_edits`.

```yaml
documents:
  include: ["**/*.md"]
  exclude: ["archive/**"]
chunking:
  target_tokens: 400
  overlap_percent: 15
  max_chars: 2000
search:
  limit: 10
  candidates: 30
  rrf_k: 60
  graph_weight: 0.15
provider:
  base_url: https://api.zeroentropy.dev/v1
  api_key_env: ZEROENTROPY_API_KEY
  embedding_model: zembed-1
  rerank_model: zerank-2
  dimensions: 1280
git:
  push: true
  remote: origin
  push_timeout_seconds: 30
server:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:3131
```

### Markdown validation

The `markdown` checks in a directory template are independently configurable and disabled when
omitted. They impose no required frontmatter, section names, or initial heading
level. `heading_increment` rejects jumps such as H2 to H4; decreasing levels is
allowed. `fence_language` requires a nonempty info string, not a fixed language
list. `nonempty_links` checks parsed Markdown link destinations.

Whitespace and line-length checks cover the body, excluding fenced and indented
code blocks. Exactly two trailing spaces on a nonblank line are allowed for
Markdown hard breaks. Line length counts Unicode characters, not bytes; CRLF
and LF endings are accepted. `final_newline` covers the entire nonempty file.

Failures include the rule name, page path, and one-based source line. Checks run
at startup, on `validate`, and against the complete proposed tree before an edit
is committed. Incoming template changes are validated against every selected page before activation. Invalid batches change nothing; there is no auto-formatting.
These are explicit checks on CommonMark parsing, not a guarantee that every
typo is rejected: unmatched emphasis and undefined reference syntax can still
be ordinary text, and link fragments are not checked against headings.

### Directory templates

Place `template.md` beside the documents it governs. The nearest ancestor
template applies recursively and replaces its parent. Use directories such as
`tasks/v1/` and `tasks/v2/` for incompatible formats; no version registry is needed.
Templates are readable through `get_page`, protected from `apply_edits`, and
excluded from search and embeddings.

Markdown supplies instructions and examples. Only top-level fences labelled
exactly `starlark` execute; their contents form one module in document order.
See the complete [task template](examples/tasks/v1/template.md).

Declarations register rules checked by Rust:

| Declaration | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `frontmatter(**fields)` | Define fields; unknown fields are rejected. `fields={...}` supports arbitrary names; `allow_extra=True` permits extra fields. |
| `string(...)`, `integer(...)`, `boolean(...)`, `enum(values, ...)`, `list_of(item, ...)` | Field constructors with `required=False` and `nullable=False`. Strings accept length/pattern constraints, integers minimum/maximum, and lists `unique`/`min_items`. |
| `field(schema, required=False)` | Construct a field from JSON Schema, including nested objects. |
| `section(heading, ...)` | Require or constrain a section. Defaults to H2; `parent=[...]` addresses previously declared parent sections. |
| `dated_list(order="ascending", min_items=1, allow_equal_timestamps=True)` | Unordered entries starting with RFC3339 timestamps and explanations, ordered by instant. |
| `filename(pattern, serial_scope=[])` | Match the complete repository-relative path; named regex captures define serial scopes. |
| `metadata(**pointers)` | Project frontmatter fields through JSON pointers. |
| `markdown(**rules)` | Set style checks, such as `final_newline`, `closed_fences`, and `max_line_length`. |
| `links(markdown=True, wiki=[])` | Select link syntax; wiki regexes require a named `target` capture. |
| `relation(name, selector, reciprocal=None)` | Select authored links or frontmatter arrays; reciprocal facts must be authored in the same batch. |
| `structure(level=None, order="unrestricted", additional_sections=True)` | Set root heading policy before declaring sections. |
| `preamble(**rules)` | Constrain content before the declared sections. |

Section rules include `required`, `nonempty`, `include_subsections`, and `content`
(`paragraphs`, `list`, `table`, `code`, `blockquotes`, `empty`, or `dated_list()`).
`paragraphs`, `words`, `characters`, and `list_items` accept `minimum`/`maximum`
bounds. A plain `list` rule accepts `ordered`, `minimum_items`, `item_pattern`, and
`date_order` for YYYY-MM-DD prefixes. Declared sections cannot repeat among
siblings. Timeline entries may contain continuation paragraphs and nested lists.

Custom rules use `validate(callback)` for a document or
`validate_change(callback)` for an atomic edit's `before, after` snapshots.
Creation supplies `before=None`; deletion supplies `after=None`. Call
`require(condition, message, field="state")` or `require(..., at=entry)` to reject
with a source location. Callbacks return `None`; schema failures skip document
callbacks, and document failures prevent change validation.

Documents expose immutable `path`, `text`, `frontmatter`, `links`, `line`, and
`sections`. Sections are keyed by heading text (last occurrence for duplicate
names) and expose `text`, `level`, `line`, and `entries`. Entries expose
`timestamp` (RFC3339 or `None`), `text`, `links` (destination strings), and `line`.
YAML frontmatter must be a mapping with unique keys; values are never coerced.

Modules are compiled and frozen at activation. Each evaluation has limits of
100,000 ticks, 16 MiB of Starlark heap, and 64 stack frames; source is limited to
1 MiB. No imports, filesystem, network, clock, or random APIs are available.
These interpreter limits are best-effort, not process isolation.

Every atomic edit validates the full proposed corpus and its transitions before
writing. External Git imports and startup validate the final snapshot against
its templates; they do not replay historical transitions.

On creation, the single `path` argument accepts `{serial}` or `{serial:03}`.
The placeholder must occupy the filename pattern's named `serial` capture.
Under the repository lock, allocation chooses the greatest current serial in
`serial_scope` plus one, including other creates in the batch. Padding is a
minimum width, capped at 12. Deleting the highest serial permits reuse. Unknown
or repeated placeholders and placeholders on other edit operations are rejected.
Allocation changes only the path, and retries consult durable receipts first.
Resolved paths are returned in `touched_paths` and `fresh_hashlines`.

`get_page` returns `template: {path, definition, content}`, also for proposed paths
with `exists: false`. The definition contains declared rules; content is the
original Markdown. Template updates are authored externally and activated through
validated Git synchronization.

## Local durability and background Git synchronization

An accepted edit is committed locally before it returns. It never waits for a
network request, including when retrying an already-applied batch. The response's
`push` state describes current replication, not edit success. Embedding rebuilds
and Git synchronization are independent background activities.

With `git.push: true`, the running daemon synchronizes at startup, after edits,
and every 30 seconds while healthy. Failures retry with exponential backoff from
1 second to a 5-minute ceiling, even if no further edits arrive. The existing
`git.push_timeout_seconds` bounds each network operation. Network failures are
recorded in status and do not block local writes. `git.push: false` disables the
worker. `mdstore push` explicitly attempts one synchronization immediately.

The worker fetches the configured branch into a private ref. A fast-forward
candidate's complete tree, configuration, templates, and sidecar ignore rules
must validate before the live branch, checkout, or published state changes.
Invalid incoming trees leave the accepted state untouched. Valid listener/auth
changes are staged in private Git state and reported as requiring restart.
Restart revalidates and activates the staged fast-forward before binding the
new listener. If local history advanced meanwhile, the stale stage is discarded
without overwriting local work; synchronization must reconcile the new state. Divergent histories
block further writes until explicitly reconciled; the daemon never merges or
rewrites history. A subsequent sync clears the divergence block once the
histories are compatible again.

Network operations run outside the edit lock. Pushes target a captured commit,
so a newer edit remains pending if it arrives during a push. Short local
activation/publication steps still use the repository lock. The daemon owns the
live checkout: make external changes in another checkout and publish through Git.

`status` and `/health` expose `replication.pending_commits`,
`replication.last_success` (Unix seconds), and `replication.last_error`, separately
from vector coverage. Progress reflects the last observed remote state, not a
live remote query. Last success/error survive daemon restarts and are scoped to a fingerprint of
the resolved fetch URL, push URL, and destination branch. Changing the destination
invalidates the previous progress report; pending commits are reconstructed from
destination-specific Git acknowledgements, never inferred from an old upstream. Replication metadata is private Git state.

## CLI

Run `serve` first. Every other command is an HTTP client of that daemon, using
`server.listen` and `server.bearer_token_env` from the repository configuration.
Use global `--daemon-url` or `MDSTORE_URL` when the daemon was started at an
overridden address.

```sh
mdstore --root /path/to/brain validate
mdstore --root /path/to/brain serve
mdstore --root /path/to/brain search "query" --variant "caller expansion"
mdstore --root /path/to/brain get people/alice.md
mdstore --root /path/to/brain get config.yaml
mdstore --root /path/to/brain apply --file edits.json
mdstore --root /path/to/brain reindex
mdstore --root /path/to/brain status
mdstore --root /path/to/brain push
```

An edit request uses `LINE:HASH` anchors returned by `get_page`:

```json
{
  "edit_summary": "Link Alice and Bob",
  "edits": [
    {
      "op": "insert_after",
      "path": "people/alice.md",
      "anchor": "12:a3",
      "content": "- [Bob](bob.md)"
    },
    {
      "op": "insert_after",
      "path": "people/bob.md",
      "anchor": "9:f1",
      "content": "- [Alice](alice.md)"
    }
  ]
}
```

All anchors in a request resolve against the same pre-edit snapshot. Stale,
ambiguous, or overlapping edits fail before any worktree file changes.

The MCP endpoint is `/mcp`; health and indexing coverage are available from
`/health`. A configured bearer token protects both endpoints, and listening
beyond loopback is refused without one. Startup reuses valid sidecars and
rebuilds only missing or stale vectors; the explicit `reindex` command forces a
complete rebuild.
